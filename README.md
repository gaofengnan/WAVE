# WAVE

(By Ting Chen, [Fengnan Gao](https://gaofn.xyz/ "Fengnan's Homepage") and [Yan-Wen Tan](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/f7/50/c7605a63312/page.htm "Yan-Wen's faculty page"))

Implementation of WAVE (**W**asserstein distance **A**nalysis in steady-state **V**ariations in smFR**E**T) to detect and locate non-equilibrium transition positions in FRET trajectories, which is first introduced in Chen, Gao and Tan (2023).[^1]

## Description of main functions

1. **`TestNonequilibrium3`**: The core of WAVE and the main function.

2. **`MakeNonequilibriumHMMPoissonData`**: This script generates simulated data (FRET trajectories) via HMM.

3. **`NonequilibriumCompare`**: This script evaluates the analysis result after `TestNonequilibrium3` has finished processing the simulated data generated by `MakeNonequilibriumHMMPoissonData`.

## User guide

### Run `TestNonequilibrium3` individually

Run `TestNonequilibrium3` script in Matlab, and select a folder with structure as follows:

***
**Folder_name** (a folder containing all FRET trajectories)  

-->**XXX.txt** (records intensity-time trajectory, containing 2 columns data with same length. The first column is the intensity-time trajectory of donor channel, and the second column is the intensity-time trajectory of acceptor channel)  
------**E** (a folder, contain FRET efficiency and region information of all trajectories in FRET folder)  
--------->**XXX.txt Efficiency.txt** (corresponding to XXX.txt, records FRET efficiency-time  trajectory in the first column, with the same length as intensity-time trajectory. In FRET region: [FRETbegin, FRETend], the recorded FRET efficiency~=0, while in crosstalk region [Crosstalkbegin, Crosstalkend] and background region [Backgroundbegin, Backgroundend], the recorded FRET efficiency=0)  
--------->**XXX.txt Region.txt** (corresponding to XXX.txt, records region boundaries. This file contains 6 elements, like follows [FRETbegin, FRETend, Crosstalkbegin, Crosstalkend, Backgroundbegin, Backgroundend])
***

We advise the user study the `test` folder for this specific structure of organizing data.

```text

├── BestHMMParameters2.mat
├── BNESTAnanysis.mat
├── DataSetInformation.mat
├── E
│   ├── test1.txt Efficiency.txt
│   ├── test1.txt Region.txt
│   ├── test2.txt Efficiency.txt

│   ├── test3.txt Region.txt
|   └── test3.txt Region.txt
├── test1.txt
├── test2.txt
└── test3.txt
```

**Note**: Set carefully the parameters in `TestNonequilibrium3` before running, especially `Changeframe`, which represents the time point at which the conditions change, depending on the experimental design.

### Test `TestNonequilibrium3` with simulated data

Follow the steps below:

1. Create an empty folder `new_folder` to save simulated data.  
2. Run `MakeNonequilibriumHMMPoissonData` with the newly created empty folder `new_folder`.  
3. Run `TestNonequilibrium3` with the folder `new_folder` containing simulated data.  
4. Evaluate the output with `NonequilibriumCompare`.

**Note**: The evaluation criteria in `NonequilibriumCompare` should match the kinetic rate coefficients set in `MakeNonequilibriumHMMPoissonData`. Read the comments in these scripts for details.

## Additional information

### Output of `TestNonequilibrium3`

**BNESTAnanysis** is the output of `TestNonequilibrium3`. It is a `cell` table, with the following format

- 1st row: record the name of each FRET trajectory (.txt file)
- 2nd row: record the length of FRET trajectory after BNEST
- 3rd row: record the last state before BNEST
- 4th row: record the first state after BNEST
- 5th row: record the trajectory length after condition change and before BNEST
- 6th row: record the Length of last segment before BNEST
- 7th row: record the FRET trajectory after BNEST
- 8th row: record the fitting trajectory after BNEST
